# mcal
MCAL is a software to perform measurements of the effective temperature (Teff) and metallicity ([Fe/H]) of cool M-dwarf stars. This version of MCAL is a wrapper to run an adapted version of the original MCAL V.3 by Vasco Neves.

Clone and run:

./mcal.py --datadir=./data/ --calibmatrix=coef_calvb12.npz
